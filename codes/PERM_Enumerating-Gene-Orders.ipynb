    "### What is permutation?  \n",
    "In mathematics, a **_permutation_** of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word \"permutation\" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, there are six permutations (orderings) of the set {1,2,3}: written as tuples, they are (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). Anagrams of a word whose letters are all different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and the anagram reorders them. The study of permutations of finite sets is an important topic in combinatorics and group theory."
